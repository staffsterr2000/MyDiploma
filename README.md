# Summary

The application represents a clinic website that 
allows a client user to request for appointment with a specialist.

Besides, the doctor easily manages the clients' requests
 and then connection from remote turns into local, in the clinic.

New client always can make an appointment online (by registering
and creating the appointment from his profile page).
